abstract = {All college students must decide where to attend college and what major to study. We estimate how earnings by college major differ at different college selectivity types. We find major-specific earnings vary markedly by college selectivity, with the strongest differences among business majors and the weakest differences among science majors. We also find that when comparing earnings of graduates from top colleges to middle or bottom ranked colleges, the distribution of students across majors can be as important as earnings differences by major in accounting for college selectivity earnings gaps.

It is also found that earnings profiles corrected for self-selection bias have flattened for more recent graduates in business, liberal arts, and education. The life-cycle earnings in these disciplines appear to be more severely depressed than those in science and engineering. How},

We examined relevant personality characteristics (i.e., achievement motivation, conformity, conscientiousness, creativity and extroversion) of 899 students majoring in business administration fields. Students majoring in accounting and marketing and, to a lesser extent, in computer information systems and economics possessed personality characteristics that fit traditional societal steretypes of those occupations (e.g., marketing majors were the most extroverted; accounting students scored highest in conformity). The weakness of using stereotypes in choosing a major and ways that faculty members and advisors can supplant this common practice with more accurate information are discussed.

abstract = {In society, science majors are typically stereotyped as highly stressed and not very social. To see if this stereotype has any real truth to it, we measured the work load, perceived stress, and personality traits in natural science majors compared to social science and humanities majors in undergraduate college students. Science majors were found to spend more time in class but did not report having more out of class work relating to academics. No difference in personality traits was found between different majors. Stress correlated positively with neuroticism, as found in previous studies, but did not correlate with any other personality traits. Also, neuroticism correlated negatively with extraversion. Other correlations between personality traits were not reproduced. Together, these results suggest that there is no difference in stress or personality between natural science and humanities/social science students. Due to our results, this stereotype seems to be refuted.},

To date, though, this research has not been reviewed systematically. This was the aim of the present review. A systematic literature search identified twelve eligible studies yielding an aggregated sample size of 13,389. Eleven studies reported significant group differences in one or multiple Big Five personality traits. Consistent findings across studies were that students of arts/humanities and psychology scored high on Neuroticism and Openness; students of political sc. scored high on Openness; students of economics, law, political sc., and medicine scored high on Extraversion; students of medicine, psychology, arts/humanities, and sciences scored high on Agreeableness; and students of arts/humanities scored low on Conscientiousness. Effect sizes were calculated to estimate the magnitude of the personality group differences. These effect sizes were consistent across studies comparing similar pairs of academic majors. For all Big Five personality traits medium effect sizes were found frequently, and for Openness even large effect sizes were found regularly. The results from the present review indicate that substantial personality group differences across academic majors exist. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},
